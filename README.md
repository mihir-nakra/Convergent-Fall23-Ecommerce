# Innovest: Connecting Student Startups with Investors

## Overview

Welcome to Innovest, a platform dedicated to bridging the gap between student startups and investors, aiming to streamline the funding process and foster the growth of innovative ventures. Innovest tackles the common challenge faced by student startups in raising capital by providing a convenient and efficient way for them to connect with investors. Our three-step process—Apply, Connect, Invest/Grow—ensures a seamless experience for both investors and startups.

## Key Features

### 1. Apply

Investors and startups can kickstart their journey on Innovest by submitting a detailed application. The application process is designed to gather essential information for the matching algorithm and includes a verification step to ensure the legitimacy of both investors and startups.

### 2. Connect

Once the application is verified, users gain access to Innovest's ecosystem. Investors can explore potential startups, and startups can discover suitable investors, creating meaningful connections that pave the way for collaboration and growth.

### 3. Invest/Grow

For investors, this step involves making informed investment decisions based on the matches provided by our platform. Startups, on the other hand, focus on leveraging the newfound support to foster growth and ensure the longevity of their ventures.
